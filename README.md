# futurelearn-rock-paper-scissors
Course project for Programming Applications with Python GUI at Futurelearn.

This was created as my course project for Week 2.6 Offline Activity Create your GUI. 
It is to meet the objective: "Use all of your new-found knowledge about GUI programming 
to create something simple, yet functional. 
Try and incorporate all the elements that you learned up until now."

I have used elements from Week 1.7 Create a Window, Week 1.8 Buttons, Week 1.9 Labels, Week 2.2 Images, and Week 2.5 Radio Buttons.

I have not used dropdown menus or textfield.

The program is a simple version of Rock Paper Scissors. 
It compares the user-selected value (from a selected radio button) 
to a randomly generated integer to determine the game result. 
The game result is displayed in a message box window.
